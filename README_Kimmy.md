Note : Some pictures include Korean as its axis name, and this is because of the OS setting from my computer. If you run corresponding code yourself, you will get one with your local language or the language you set.

all R script files(i.e. plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R) have the same command which will check whether the file is already downloaded so that once you run one file then you won't download the same file again.

There is no order you have to follow to check 4 files. What that means is you can check "plot4.R" first and then "plot2.R", and so forth.

These are the some comments that I wanted to make before you run those files.
